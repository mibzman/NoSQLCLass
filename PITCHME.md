#### Our Stack:
<br>
- Golang
- PostgreSQL
- Gorm Object-Relational Mapper

---

### Golang:


- Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.


- a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.

---

### PostgreSQL


- an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance.


#### PostGIS


- PostGIS is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL


---

### Gorm


- Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language

---

### Our experience with Object-Relational Mappers

- useful for simple operations
	- entire object is read into memory, including it's children

- for more complex operations you can still run standard queries

## Golang?
LOL no generics
