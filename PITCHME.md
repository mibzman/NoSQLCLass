### Golang:

```
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy
to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
```

- It is a compiled, statically typed language in the 
tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, 
limited structural typing, memory safety features 
and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.

### PostgreSQL

```
an object-relational database management system 
(ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and 
standards compliance.
```

#### PostGIS

```
PostGIS is a spatial database extender for 
PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds 
support for geographic objects allowing location 
queries to be run in SQL
```

### Gorm

```
Object-relational mapping 
(ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer 
science is a programming technique for converting 
data between incompatible type systems using 
object-oriented programming languages. This creates, 
in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be 
used from within the programming language
